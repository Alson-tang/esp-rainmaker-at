Introduction
-------------

**Espressif** provides an official application `Nova Home <https://rainmaker.espressif.com>`__ to interact with the devices. You can download it through the `Google Play (Android) <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espressif.novahome&hl=en_US&gl=US>`__ or `App Store (iOS) <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nova-home/id1563728960>`__. The examples in the document use Nova Home (version: 1.6.2) as the client application by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _init-node:

1. Initialize the node.

   {IDF_TARGET_NAME} initializes the node:

   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+RMNODEINIT

   Response:

   .. code-block:: none

     OK

   Note:

   After the command is executed successfully, the node configuration will be saved internally. The node configuration that has been initialized is as follows.

   .. code-block:: none

                         ],
                         "ui_type":"esp.ui.toggle"
                     }
                 ]
             }
         ],
         "services":Array[3]
     }

5. Perform provisioning and user-node mapping.

   Please refer to :ref:`Perform provisioning and user-node mapping <prov-and-mapping>` in the example :ref:`Connect to the RainMaker cloud for simple communications in normal transmission transmode <simple-communi>`.

6. Enter passthrough mode.

   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+RMMODE=1

   Response:

   .. code-block:: none

     OK

7. Send data.

   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+RMSEND

   Response:

   .. code-block:: none

     OK

     >

   Then you can directly enter the data, enter ``1`` to switch the light to ON, and ``0`` to switch the light to OFF.

8. Stop sending data.

   When AT receives a packet that contains only ``+++``, the :term:`RainMaker Passthrough Mode` will be stopped. Then please wait at least one second before sending the next AT command. Please note that if you input ``+++`` directly by typing, the ``+++`` may not be recognized as three consecutive ``+`` because of the prolonged typing duration.

   .. Important::

     The aim of ending the packet with ``+++`` is to exit :term:`RainMaker Passthrough Mode` and to accept normal AT commands. However, you can also use command ``AT+RMSEND`` to go back into :term:`RainMaker Passthrough Mode`.

9. Actively disconnect from ESP RainMaker cloud.

   Please refer to :ref:`Actively disconnect from ESP RainMaker cloud <close-agent>` in the example :ref:`Connect to the RainMaker cloud for simple communications in normal transmission transmode <simple-communi>`.

8. Start user-node mapping.

   **Espressif** provides `rest APIs <https://swaggerapis.rainmaker.espressif.com/>`__ for RainMaker backend service.

   Firstly, you can enter ``user_name`` and ``password`` through API `/{version}/login <https://swaggerapis.rainmaker.espressif.com/#/User/login>`__ to get ``accesstoken``. Then, you can click the ``Authorize`` button to enter the obtained ``accesstoken``.

      :scale: 50 %
      :alt: REST API Login Authorize
      :figclass: align-center

      REST API Login Authorize

   Secondly, use API `/{version}/user <https://swaggerapis.rainmaker.espressif.com/#/User/getUser>`__ to get ``user_id``.

   .. figure:: ../../../_static/RainMaker/rest_api_get_user_details.png
      :align: center
      :scale: 50 %
      :alt: REST API Get User Details
      :figclass: align-center

      REST API Get User Details

   Thirdly, enter ``node_id`` and ``secret_key`` through API `/{version}/user/nodes/mapping <https://swaggerapis.rainmaker.espressif.com/#/User%20Node%20Association/addRemoveUserNodeMapping>`__ to get ``request_id``. As shown in the figure below, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} adds "84F70308E0E8" as ``node_id`` and "test" as ``secret_key``.

   .. figure:: ../../../_static/RainMaker/rest_api_get_request_id.png
      :align: center
      :scale: 50 %
      :alt: REST API Get request id
      :figclass: align-center

      REST API Get request id

   Finally, use :ref:`AT+RMUSERMAPPING <cmd-RMUSERMAPPING>` to start user-node mapping.

   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+RMUSERMAPPING="GitHub_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","test"

   Response:

   .. code-block:: none

     OK

   If the mapping completes, the system returns:

   .. code-block:: none

     +RMMAPPINGDONE

   Then, refresh the app and you should see the newly added device.

   Note:

   This command does not guarantee success of the actual mapping. The mapping status needs to be checked separately by the clients (Phone app/CLI).

9. Clear user-node mapping. (optional)

   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+RMUSERUNMAPPING

   Response:

   .. code-block:: none

     OK
